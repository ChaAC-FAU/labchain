# labChain

This project is a completely new blockchain-based coin, with P2P networking, a consensus mechanism and a wallet interface. The goal of the project is to provide a framework that is easy to modify for people who want to develop proof-of-concepts for blockchain-based technology.

DO NOT USE THIS AS A REAL CURRENCY TO SEND, RETRIEVE, OR STORE ACTUAL MONEY! While we do not currently know of any way to do so, there are almost certainly bugs in this implementation that would allow anyone to create money out of the blue or take yours away from you.

**Running the code**

You need python3 to be able to run the code. To install the requirements, that are listed in the "requirements.txt", file you should run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".

If you are in a Debian variant OS you can run the following commands (from inside the labchain code folder) to have everything set-up:

sudo apt-get install python3

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
